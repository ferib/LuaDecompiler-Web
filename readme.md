# LuaDecompiler Website
This is the webpage for the Lua Decompiler project.

Unfortunately, the core component of the LuaDecompiler project is closed-source, therefore I have decided to provide an open REST API together with a basic website that can be used for free, enjoy!

# Private LuaDecompiler
The private LuaDecompiler is just a Lua 5.1 decompiler that is written in C#.
